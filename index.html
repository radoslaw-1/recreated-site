J has a great eye for the small details but never forgets the high-level strategy and vision. He has a sense of leadership that is unparalleled to any other I have seen in my career history. He's honest and is not afraid to tell you like it is, but he also encourages everyone to participate and voice their opinions.</p>

                                <p>Building digital products people love in the buyer-driven economy.</p>
                                <p>The economy has shifted. It was seller-driven, when companies could be successful with limited customer research and brute-force marketing. Now it's buyer-driven, where anyone can find products and services to fit their needs in just a few clicks.</p>
                                <p>It's time companies embraced customer research, and rapid-prototyping, and built meaningful value propositions based on real customer needs and wants.</p>
                                <p>We'll look at the 5 Phases of product design and lay out a playbook for success in the new age.</p>
                                <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                                <p>1/ Product design is not a linear process, rather it involves tight collaboration and fluid switching between diverse skill sets.</p>
                                <p>2/ Customer research is an art, and applying some simple methodologies can help create a clear vision of customer needs.</p>
                                <p>3/ Successful businesses make research and prototyping an integral part of their culture, using research and data to drive critical product and business decisions.</p>

                                <h3>Redesign Your Design Thinking</h3>
                                <p>Design is beautiful and beautiful things are well-designed. While this is true, it isn’t the whole truth—aesthetics definitely are NOT everything. Sometimes the best design isn’t what you think, and we need to leave our design aesthetic ego at the door and focus on positive outcomes for the user. This talk will challenge your assumptions about what great design is, and discuss ideas about how we can be better designers by focusing on process, function, and outcomes instead of visuals.</p>

                                <h3>Digital Fluency & User Experience</h3>
                                <p>A look at the idea of digital fluency and how different levels of understanding can impact experience in ways we might not have considered before; some of the psychology behind how fluency influences judgement and perception of digital experiences, and how we can approach experience design to build meaningful connections with the people who use our creations.</p>

                                <h3>Design for Business</h3>
                                <p>Many companies are so full of enthusiasm for their idea that they overlook the fundamentals of design and its importance in building great products, services, and businesses. This talk covers the core design principals that Founders and CEO's  need to consider from the beginning.</p>
